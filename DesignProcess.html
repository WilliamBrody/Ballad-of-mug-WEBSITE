            <h1>Design Process</h1>
            <p>We started out with a basic character sketch to get an idea of what we wanted the atmopshere of our game to look like.</p>
            <img src="IMG_2947.JPG" alt="initial charecter sketches" width=300 height=auto>
            <p>We then started to draw out levels based on where collision should take place. this will help us later on when we design our levels. </p>

            <h2>Accessibility</h2>
            <p>
                Ballad of Mug is an accessible game to all players, deliberately choosing text, color, sound, visualization, and interactivity in regards to cognitive ability, players receiving feedback from the game, and players providing input to the game.
                Feedback<br>
                The game’s gray-scale color palette allows color-blind users to experience the game like other players.<br>
                Everything on the screen is easy to see, allowing visually-impaired players to experience the game like other players.<br>
                Cognitive ability<br>
                The game has two modes of difficulty that adjusts how many hearts the animal takes away from the user each attack.<br>
                Input<br>
                It is possible to complete the game without dashing, enabling easy control of player movement.<br>
                With only four controls, players don’t have to burden themselves with memorizing a plethora of keybinds.<br>
            </p>
